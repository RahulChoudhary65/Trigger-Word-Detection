Folder Size and .ipynb file size is large.So I wanna to provide whole folder google-drive link. 

[Trigger Word Detection Google-Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15gma-zH-MdhJ_9Qol_n9bzkEoHW7Whjc?usp=sharing)







Structured a speech recognition system with the help of sequence models.
Synthesized and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets.
Train a trigger word word detection model and make predictions.
Audio sampled at 44100 Hz frequency.
Compute a spectrogram of the audio cli(tells how much different frequencies in the clip)
model ingest a spectrogram and output a signal when it detects the trigger word.
model contains 1-D convolutional  layer,2 GRU layers and one time distributed dense layer
